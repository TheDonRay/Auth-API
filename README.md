# Auth-API

> A hands-on learning project for understanding JWT authentication and building secure login systems from scratch.

## 📚 About This Project

This repository documents my journey learning authentication fundamentals by building a complete auth system. The goal is to deeply understand how JWT tokens work, how to implement secure login flows, and the security considerations that go into protecting user data.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

**Authentication Fundamentals**
- How JWT tokens work (header, payload, signature)
- Token-based vs session-based authentication
- Password hashing and secure credential storage
- Token lifecycle management (generation, validation, expiration)

**Security Best Practices**
- Protecting against XSS and CSRF attacks
- Secure token storage strategies
- Implementing protected routes
- Handling authentication middleware

**Practical Implementation**
- Building login and registration flows
- Creating protected API endpoints
- Managing token expiration and refresh
- Proper error handling and validation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing
